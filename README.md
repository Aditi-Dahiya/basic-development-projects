This is where you should start your open source contributions if you're an absolute beginner. You're expected to make mistakes here, raise issues and get comfortable with the process of contributing to open source projects.

## How to contribute
0. Learn the basics of Git and Github.
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Checkout to a new branch for every new contribution you make, or an issue you fix.
4. You can ask for help on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ttYFsAwKhY), or on the whatsapp group, if you're stuck.
5. Improve the existing projects before moving on to the intermediate ones.
